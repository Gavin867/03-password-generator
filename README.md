## Lessons Learned

#### Every Structure Starts with a Framework

* Thinking about each step that needed to happen took away the stress of having to remember exactly how the code itself needed to be written and allowed me to paint the picture first
* Also helps you to remember what you still need to work on
* Lets other people see your reasoning for things when they're trying to help you debug
